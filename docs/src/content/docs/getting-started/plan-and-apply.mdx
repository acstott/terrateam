The Plan and Apply operations are the core of Terrateam's functionality. They allow you to preview and execute changes to your infrastructure in a controlled and collaborative manner.

## Plan

The Plan operation generates a preview of changes that will be made to your infrastructure when you apply your Terraform code. This preview is called a "plan" in Terraform terminology.
Here's a example of a common usage of the plan feature:
<Steps>
1. Open a pull request with changes to your Terraform code.

   ![Terrateam pull request](../../../assets/nibbler-pull-request.png)

2. Terrateam automatically triggers a Plan operation.

   ![Terrateam plan](../../../assets/nibbler-terrateam-plan.png)

3. Review the plan output in the PR comment. It shows what will be created, modified, or destroyed:

    ![Terrateam plan](../../../assets/nibbler-terrateam-plan.png)

4. Collaborate with your team based on the plan output and review the changes before they are executed.
</Steps>

You can manually trigger another Plan by commenting `terrateam plan` on the pull request.

:::note
Plans are read-only operations that don't change your infrastructure, so they're safe to run repeatedly as you refine your code.
:::

## Apply

The Apply operation executes the changes previewed in the Plan. This is when actual infrastructure changes occur.
Here's an example of a common usage of the apply feature:
<Steps>
1. Ensure your pull request has a successful Plan operation.

2. Comment `terrateam apply` on the pull request.

3. Terrateam acquires a lock on the affected directories to prevent conflicting changes.

4. Terrateam runs the Apply operation:

   ![Terrateam Apply](../../../assets/nibbler-terrateam-apply.png)

5. Verify the apply was successful by reviewing the output.

6. Merge the pull request to complete your workflow.

7. Terrateam automatically releases the lock.
</Steps>

:::caution
If another PR is trying to apply changes to the same directory, it will be blocked until the [current lock is released](/advanced-workflows/locks-and-concurrency/). This prevents conflicting changes from being applied simultaneously.

### Apply Requirements

Terrateam has a set of [Apply Requirements](/configuration-reference/apply-requirements) that must be met before an Apply operation can be triggered. These include:

- Requiring a certain number of [approvals](/configuration-reference/apply-requirements#approved) on the pull request
- Ensuring there are no [merge conflicts](/configuration-reference/apply-requirements#merge-conflicts)
- Checking that all [status checks](/configuration-reference/apply-requirements#status-checks) have passed

You can configure these requirements in your [Terrateam configuration file](/getting-started/configuration).
### Auto-Apply

Automatically apply changes when a pull request is merged using [When Modified](/configuration-reference/when-modified).

:::note 
   Useful for repositories where merged changes are always expected to be applied, like production environments.

## Apply Workflows: Pre-merge vs Post-merge

Terrateam offers two primary workflows based on when changes are applied:

**Pre-merge Workflow:**
- Greater safety and visibility
- More complex
- Recommended for critical infrastructure

**Post-merge Workflow:**
- Simpler and faster
- Increased risk
- Suitable for less sensitive environments

For stability-critical environments, consider a pre-merge workflow with [automerge](/configuration-reference/automerge) for balanced validation and efficiency.
