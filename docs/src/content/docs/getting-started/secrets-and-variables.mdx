Terrateam offers multiple ways to manage sensitive information and customize your Terraform configurations using GitHub secrets, variables, or `.tfvars` files. All methods produce the same outcome, allowing you to choose the approach that best fits your workflow and needs for managing Terraform variables.

## GitHub Secrets and Variables

### Environment Variables

GitHub [Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) and [Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables) can be used to set environment variables. They are translated into environment variables in the Terrateam GitHub Action runtime environment. These environment variables may be referenced in your Terraform code.

## Defining a GitHub Secret

You can use the GitHub CLI or the web interface to define a GitHub secret.

### Using GitHub CLI

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to create a secret named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`:

    ```bash
    gh secret set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --body "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
    ```

### Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Access the repository with the Terrateam app installed.
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.

3. Click on **New repository secret**.
    ![Step 3: New repository secret](../../../assets/new-repo-secret.png)
4. Specify the **Name** (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`) and a **Secret value** (`AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`).
5. Click **Add secret**.

## Using GitHub Secrets in Terraform

Secrets and variables that start with `TF_VAR_` are treated specially by Terrateam.

GitHub secrets and variables are always uppercase, however by convention Terraform variables are lowercase. Terrateam automatically finds all secrets that start with `TF_VAR_` and creates a new environment variable that has the lowercase name. If the lowercase name exists, no action is taken. The uppercase environment variable is left unchanged. For example, the secret `TF_VAR_LOGIN_TOKEN` will create a new environment variable called `TF_VAR_login_token`.

This will create an environment variable `TF_VAR_database_password` which Terraform can automatically map to a variable named `database_password` in your Terraform configuration.

```hcl
variable "database_password" {
  description = "Password for database connection"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  # Other configuration...
  password = var.database_password
}
```
### Security

GitHub secrets are stored encrypted at rest using a [libsodium sealed box](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes) and are only decrypted when used in GitHub Actions workflows. 

When Terrateam runs your Terraform operations:
1. Encrypted secrets are decrypted within the GitHub Actions runtime.
2. Decrypted secrets are available as environment variables within the GitHub Actions runner.
<Aside type="tip" title="Your data is safe!">
Your sensitive data appears only in the encrypted Terraform plan files.
Terrateam does not store your unencrypted secrets on its servers.
</Aside>

The Terraform plan files, which may contain your secrets, are stored temporarily during the planning and application process, then deleted.

## Hooks and Workflows

Terrateam also allows you to set environment variables using [Hooks](/configuration-reference/hooks) and [Workflows](/configuration-reference/workflows).

### Hooks

You can set an environment variable at the very start of a Terrateam operation using Hooks.

```yaml
hooks:
  plan:
    pre:
      - type: env
        name: FOO
        cmd: ['echo', 'BAR']
  apply:
    pre:
      - type: env
        name: BAZ
        cmd: ['echo', 'QUX']
```

The following code snippet shows how to set a dynamic environment variable based on the current Git branch:

```yaml
hooks:
  plan:
    pre:
      - type: env
        name: ENVIRONMENT
        cmd: ['bash', '-c', 'echo $(git branch --show-current | cut -d "/" -f2)']
```

### Workflows

You can also set an environment variable at the start of each Plan and Apply operation.

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: env
        name: FOO
        cmd: ["echo", "BAR"]
      - type: plan
    apply:
      - type: init
      - type: env
        name: FOO
        cmd: ["echo", "BAR"]
      - type: apply
```

The following code snippet shows how to set a timestamp for resource tagging:

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: env
        name: TF_VAR_deployment_timestamp
        cmd: ["date", "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S"]
      - type: plan
```

## `.tfvars` Files

Terraform allows you to define variables in `.tfvars` files, which can be used to customize your Terraform configurations.

To use a `.tfvars` file with Terrateam, you can specify the file path in your workflow configuration using the `extra_args` option.

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: ""
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
        extra_args: ["-var-file=qa.tfvars"]
    apply:
      - type: init
      - type: apply
```

The following code snippet shows an example of a `.tfvars` file:

```hcl
# qa.tfvars
region        = "us-west-2"
instance_type = "t3.micro"
vpc_cidr      = "10.0.0.0/16"
environment   = "qa"
```

In this example, the `qa.tfvars` file will be used during the plan step, providing environment-specific variable values to your Terraform configuration.
