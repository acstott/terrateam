Get up and running with Terrateam in minutes. Choose your starting point:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard 
    title="Try the demo repository"
    description="Learn Terrateam's workflow with simulated infrastructure. No cloud credentials needed. Perfect for getting started."
    href="#option-1-try-the-demo-recommended"

  <LinkCard

    description="Jump straight into using Terrateam with your existing Terraform code and real infrastructure."
    href="#option-2-set-up-your-own-repository"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Prerequisites

- **A GitHub account** 
- **Administrator access** to install the Terrateam GitHub app

## Option 1: Try the demo (recommended)

Perfect for learning Terrateam. This demo uses null resources instead of real infrastructure, so you can learn Terrateam's workflow without any cloud setup.

<LinkCard
  title="Terrateam Demo Repository"
  href="https://github.com/terrateam-demo/kick-the-tires"
/>

<Steps>
1. **Fork the demo repository**

   Click the link above and fork the repository to your GitHub account.
   
2. **Enable GitHub Actions Workflows**
   
   :::warning
   Forked repositories disable workflows by default for security reasons.
   :::
   
   - Go to your forked repository and click the **Actions** tab
   - You'll likely see "Workflows aren't being run on this forked repository"
   - Click on **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**

3. **Install the Terrateam GitHub App**

   Sign up for Terrateam and install the GitHub app on your account/organization.
   
   <LinkCard
     title="Install Terrateam GitHub App"
     href="https://github.com/apps/terrateam-action"
   />

4. **Try it out**

   - Edit `dev/main.tf` - change `count = 0` to `count = 1`
   - Create a new branch and push your changes
   - Open a pull request
   - Watch Terrateam automatically comment with the Terraform plan!

5. **Apply the changes**

   Comment `terrateam apply` on the PR to apply the changes.
</Steps>

### What you'll see

When you open your first PR, Terrateam will automatically comment with the terraform plan output:

![Terrateam Plan](../../../assets/demo-plan-output.png)

This demo uses `null_resource`, which doesn't provision anything. This is just a way to show how Terrateam runs the Terraform workflow safely.

:::note
This demo doesn't persist Terraform state between runs. Each `terraform plan` starts fresh, so you won't see destroy operations for previously created resources. This keeps the demo simple, but real Terrateam deployments use persistent state backends.

## Option 2: Set up your own repository

Ready to use Terrateam with your existing Terraform code? Here's how to get started:

<Steps>
1. **Install the Terrateam GitHub App**

   If you haven't already, install Terrateam on your GitHub account/organization.
   
   <LinkCard
     title="Install Terrateam GitHub App"
     href="https://github.com/apps/terrateam-action"
   />

2. **Add the GitHub Actions Workflow**

   **Critical:** The workflow file must be in your default branch (`main` or `master`)

   ```bash
   # Quick setup - copy/paste this entire block
   git checkout -b add-terrateam-workflow && \
   mkdir -p .github/workflows && \
   curl -o .github/workflows/terrateam.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrateamio/terrateam-example/refs/heads/main/github/actions/workflows/default/terrateam.yml && \
   git add .github/workflows/terrateam.yml && \
   git commit -m "Add Terrateam workflow" && \
   git push -u origin add-terrateam-workflow
   ```

   **Alternative:** Manually create `.github/workflows/terrateam.yml` and copy the contents from [this workflow file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrateamio/terrateam-example/refs/heads/main/github/actions/workflows/default/terrateam.yml).

   **Next:** Create a pull request and merge it into your default branch to activate the workflow.

3. **Configure your repository**

   Terrateam works automatically with most Terraform repositories. Simply ensure your repository has:
   - `.tf` files in your project
   - A valid Terraform configuration
   - Proper cloud provider credentials (configured as GitHub secrets or environment variables)

4. **Create your first pull request**

   - Make changes to any `.tf` file
   - Create a pull request
   - Terrateam will automatically run `terraform plan` and comment on your PR

5. **Apply Changes**

   Comment `terrateam apply` on your PR to execute the planned changes.
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

**Terrateam isn't commenting on my PR?**
- Check your repository's Actions tab for disabled workflows
- Verify the Terrateam GitHub App is installed on your repository
- Make sure your PR changes Terraform files (`.tf` files)
