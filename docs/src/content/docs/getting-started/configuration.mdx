description: Understanding the Terrateam configuration file and how to customize your workflow
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Terrateam configuration file (`config.yml`) is the primary way to customize how Terrateam interacts with your GitHub repository and Terraform code. This file is stored in the `.terrateam` directory at the root of your repository.

:::note
The `.terrateam/config.yml` file is the source of truth for Terrateam's behavior in your repository.
:::

## Basic Structure

The `config.yml` file is written in YAML and has the following basic structure:

```yaml
access_control:
  # Specifies user permissions for operations
apply_requirements:
  # Defines preconditions for applying changes
dirs:
  # Maps directories to tags, workspaces, and behaviors
hooks:
  # Executes custom commands before or after operations
workflows:
  # Configures specialized plan and apply processes

```

Each section serves a specific purpose in customizing Terrateam's behavior:

- **access_control**: Controls who can run plan and apply operations
- **apply_requirements**: Defines conditions that must be met before changes can be applied
- **dirs**: Maps your repository's directory structure to Terrateam's concepts
- **hooks**: Allows custom actions before or after operations
- **workflows**: Creates specialized processing for different directories or environments

## Access Control

Access Control allows you to define policies for who can perform various Terrateam operations, such as planning and applying changes. You can configure access based on individual users, GitHub teams, or repository collaborator roles.

Here's an example `access_control` configuration:

```yaml
access_control:
  policies:
    - tag_query: ''  # Empty string matches all directories
      plan: ['*']    # Anyone can plan
      apply: ['team:sre']  # Only SRE team members can apply
```

This configuration allows anyone to trigger a Plan operation but restricts Apply operations to members of the `sre` team.

:::note
The `tag_query` field is used to match specific directories or environments. An empty string (`''`) matches all directories. You can use it to create different access policies for different parts of your infrastructure, like `tag_query: 'production'` to set stricter permissions for production environments.
:::

For more information, see the [Access Control](/configuration-reference/access-control) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Apply Requirements

Apply Requirements allows you to specify conditions that must be met before an Apply operation can be performed on an unmerged pull request. This helps ensure that changes are properly reviewed and validated before being applied.

Here's an example `apply_requirements` configuration with explanations:

```yaml
apply_requirements:
  # Creates a status check that prevents merging until apply is complete
  create_pending_apply_check: true
  
  checks:
    - tag_query: ""  # Apply to all directories
      
      # Requires PR approvals
      approved:
        enabled: true        # Enable approval checking
        any_of: []           # No specific approvers required
        any_of_count: 2      # Requires at least two approvals
        all_of: []           # No mandatory approvers
      
      # Prevents apply if merge conflicts exist
      merge_conflicts:
        enabled: true
      
      # Requires all status checks to pass
      status_checks:
        enabled: true              # Enable status check verification
        ignore_matching:           # Regex patterns for checks to ignore
          - "ci/.*"                # Ignores all CI status checks
```

This configuration requires that the pull request has at least two approvals, no merge conflicts, and all status checks (except those matching `ci/.*`) have passed before an apply can be performed.

When `create_pending_apply_check` is enabled, Terrateam will create a `Terrateam Apply` GitHub status check. Combined with [GitHub Rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets), this prevents the pull request from being merged until all Apply operations have completed.

For more information, see the [Apply Requirements](/configuration-reference/apply-requirements) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Dirs

Dirs allow you to define which [Tags](/advanced-workflows/tags), Workspaces, and [When Modified](/configuration-reference/when-modified) rules apply to specific directories in your repository.

Here's an example `dirs` configuration:

```yaml
dirs:
  ec2:  # Directory name (relative to repository root)
    tags: [aws, ec2]  # Directory-level tags
    workspaces:
      production:  # Workspace name
        tags: [production]  # Workspace-specific tags
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["ec2/*.tf", "ec2/*.tfvars", "iam/*.tf", "iam/*.tfvars"]
  iam:
    tags: [aws, iam]
```

This configuration:

1. Assigns directory-level tags `aws` and `ec2` to the `ec2` directory
2. Assigns directory-level tags `aws` and `iam` to the `iam` directory
3. Creates a `production` workspace for the `ec2` directory with the tag `production`
4. Specifies custom file patterns that, when modified, will trigger Terrateam operations for the `ec2` directory

:::note[Directory vs. Workspace Tags]
- **Directory tags** (`tags` at the directory level) apply to all operations in that directory across all workspaces
- **Workspace tags** (`tags` under a specific workspace) only apply when operating on that specific workspace
- Tags are used in tag queries (like `tag_query: "aws"`) to target specific operations
:::

Terrateam also supports glob patterns in the `dirs` directive, allowing you to match multiple directories with similar configurations. The `${DIR}` variable can be used to specify the directory that Terrateam is working against, relative to the root of the repository.

For more information, see the [Dirs](/configuration-reference/dirs) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to run custom commands or set environment variables before (pre-hooks) or after (post-hooks) Terrateam operations. There are three types of Hooks:

- `all`: Executed for both Plan and Apply operations
- `plan`: Executed only for Plan operations
- `apply`: Executed only for Apply operations

Here's an example `hooks` configuration:

```yaml
hooks:
  all:  # Apply to all operations (plan & apply)
    pre:  # Run before the operation
      - type: run
        cmd: ['echo', 'Running pre-hook for all operations']
  plan:  # Apply only to plan operations
    post:  # Run after the operation
      - type: run
        cmd: ['echo', 'Running post-hook for plan operations']
```

For more details, see the [Hooks](/configuration-reference/hooks) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Workflows

Workflows allow you to define custom steps for Terrateam's Plan and Apply operations. You can use Workflows to replace or augment the default behavior.

Here's an example `workflows` configuration:

```yaml
workflows:
  # This workflow applies to any directory tagged with "production"
  # (This could match directories set with tags: [production] in the dirs section)
  - tag_query: "production"
    plan:
      - type: init  # Run terraform init
      - type: plan  # Run terraform plan
        extra_args: ["-var-file=production.tfvars"]  # With these extra arguments
    apply:
      - type: init  # Run terraform init for apply
      - type: apply  # Run terraform apply
      - type: run   # Run a custom command
        cmd: ['echo', 'Error running apply']
        run_on: failure  # Only if apply fails
```

This workflow runs a custom plan and apply process for any directories tagged with `production`. The tag queries like `tag_query: "production"` match the tags defined in the `dirs` section, creating a connection between your directory structure and custom workflows.

:::note
All the examples in this page are complementary parts of a single configuration. The tag query in the workflow (`tag_query: "production"`) would match directories or workspaces tagged with `production` in the `dirs` section.
:::

For more information, see the [Workflows](/configuration-reference/workflows) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Other Configuration Options

The `config.yml` file supports many other configuration options, including:

- `engine`: Set the IaC tool to be used for operations.
- `when_modified`: Configure when Terrateam should trigger based on file changes
- `cost_estimation`: Enable and configure cost estimation for Terraform plans
- `automerge`: Automatically merge pull requests after successful applies

For a complete list of available options and their usage, refer to the [Configuration Reference](/configuration-reference) section of the documentation.
