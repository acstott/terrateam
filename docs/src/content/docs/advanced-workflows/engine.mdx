title: Choosing and Configuring an Engine
description: Learn how to select and configure the execution engine for plans and applies in Terrateam
---

Terrateam supports multiple execution engines, giving you the flexibility to choose the right tool for your workflow. Whether you are using standard Terraform, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, CDKTF, or even a fully custom engine, Terrateam makes it possible to configure plan and apply behavior that suits your needs.

You can define the [engine](/configuration-reference/engine) globally or override it per workflow by using the `engine` key in your `.terrateam/config.yml` file.

## Built In Engine Types

### Terraform (default)
```yaml
engine:
  name: terraform
```

### OpenTofu
```yaml
engine:
  name: tofu
  version: 1.9.0
```

### Terragrunt
```yaml
engine:
  name: terragrunt
  tf_version: 1.11.1
```

### CDKTF
```yaml
engine:
  name: cdktf
  tf_cmd: tofu
```

### Pulumi
```yaml
engine:
  name: pulumi
```

## Custom Engine

### Example
```yaml
engine:
  name: custom
  init: ['echo', 'init']
  plan: ['touch', '$TERRATEAM_PLAN_FILE']
  diff: ['printf', '+ added foo\n- removed bar\n~ updated bar\n']
  apply: ['cat', 'foo.txt']
  outputs: ['echo', '{"foo": "bar"}']
```

### How It Works
Each key corresponds to a step in the Terrateam workflow:

* `init` The command to run during the init step. Optional.
* `plan` The command to run during the plan step. Must write to the path specified by the `TERRATEAM_PLAN_FILE` environment variable. Required.
* `diff` The command to produce a human-readable diff of the plan output. Optional.
* `apply` The command to run during the apply step. Optional.
* `outputs` The command to return output values as a JSON string. Optional.

Only define the steps that make sense for your use case. All others can be omitted.

## Per Workflow Engines
If you have different workflows (for example, dev and prod), you can override the engine configuration per workflow. Just nest the `engine` block inside a workflow definition.

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "development"
    engine:
      name: tofu
  - tag_query: "production"
    engine:
      name: terraform
```

## Best Practices
* Use per-workflow engine configurations to maximize flexibility.
* Use `tf_version` and `tf_cmd` to control which Terraform compatible CLI is invoked.
* For custom engines, test locally with the same environment variables Terrateam uses (especially `TERRATEAM_PLAN_FILE`).
