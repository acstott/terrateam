## What is Terrateam?

Terrateam is a GitOps CI/CD platform for Terraform and OpenTofu that integrates with GitHub. It enables teams to manage infrastructure changes through pull requests.

With Terrateam, you can easily manage your infrastructure as code, collaborate with your team, and automate your deployment processes.

## How Terrateam Works

Terrateam brings GitOps principles to Terraform workflows, making infrastructure changes visible, reviewable, and safe.

<Steps>
1. **Create a Pull Request with Terraform Changes**

   When you create a pull request containing Terraform code changes, Terrateam automatically detects the modifications.
   
   ![Terrateam pull request](../../assets/nibbler-pull-request.png)

2. **Automatic Plan Operation**

   Terrateam automatically runs `terraform plan` and comments the results directly in your pull request, allowing team members to review the proposed changes.
   
   ![Terrateam plan](../../assets/nibbler-terrateam-plan.png)

3. **Apply When Ready**

   You can apply changes either before merging (to validate) or after merging (for production deployment), all through simple GitHub comments.
