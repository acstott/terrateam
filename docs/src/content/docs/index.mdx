## Why Build When You Can Leverage?
Building and maintaining a homegrown Terraform solution can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and prone to errors. For a safe and effective workflow, you must account for the following:
- Plan file storage and cleanup
- Approval steps between Plan and Apply
- Multiple pull requests with overlapping resources
- Drift Detection and Reconciliation
- Failed Apply operations
- Locks and Unlocks
- Plan and Apply restrictions
- Secure cloud integrations

Terrateam offers a battle-tested, feature-rich, and actively maintained solution that you can leverage out of the box.
