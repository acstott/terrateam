Installing Terrateam is a straightforward process. By following these three easy steps, you'll have Terrateam up and running in your GitHub repository in no time.

## Terrateam Installation

#### Step 1. [Sign up and Install the Terrateam GitHub Application](https://terrateam.io/signup)

   * **$149/mo unlimited. 14-day free trial. No credit card required.**
   * Select any of your GitHub organizations and repositories that contain Terraform code.
   * [Click here to sign up and install the Terrateam GitHub application](https://terrateam.io/signup)

#### Step 2. Add the Terrateam GitHub Actions Workflow

    * **[Download terrateam.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrateamio/terrateam-example/main/github/actions/workflows/default/terrateam.yml)**
    * The Terrateam GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/terrateam.yml`) must be stored in the default branch of your Terraform repository. The default branch is usually named `main` or `master`.

   :::note
   Create the `.github/workflows` directory if it doesn't exist. This is done for you automatically if you're using the GitHub UI (GitHub.com in a browser).

#### Step 3. Start Using Terrateam
   If you want to see how Terrateam works without connecting to your cloud provider, continue reading to deploy a simple `null_resource`. Otherwise, jump to [Cloud Providers
](/cloud-providers).

## Your First Terrateam Deployment

:::tip[Did you know?]
With Terrateam you can apply changes before or after merging a pull request.

### Plan and Apply

    We will now trigger our first Terrateam deployment by creating a simple pull request with a `null_resource`. The `null_resource` provider does not take any action against live environments
    making it completely safe for our first deployment.

<Steps>

1.  #### New Branch

    Create a new branch against a repository with Terrateam installed.

    ![Terrateam first run branch](../../assets/terrateam-first-run-branch.png)

1.  #### Add Terraform Code

    Create a new file called `main.tf` in any directory in the repository. [Download the code here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrateamio/terrateam-example/main/main.tf).

    ![Terrateam main.tf](../../assets/nibbler-main-tf.png)

1.  #### Pull Request

    Commit and push `main.tf` to your branch and then create a pull request.

    ![Terrateam pull request](../../assets/nibbler-pull-request.png)

1.  #### Terraform Plan

    Terrateam will automatically trigger a `terraform plan`.

    ![Terrateam plan](../../assets/nibbler-terrateam-plan.png)

1.  #### Terraform Apply

    Comment `terrateam apply` on the pull request. Terrateam will trigger a `terraform apply`.

    ![Terrateam Apply](../../assets/nibbler-terrateam-apply.png)

1.  #### Merge

    Merge the pull request.
