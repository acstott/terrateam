---

Running Terrateam in production requires thoughtful infrastructure decisions to ensure reliability, security, and scalability. This guide outlines best practices specific to Terrateam deployments.

## Database (PostgreSQL)

Terrateam requires a PostgreSQL database to store state and workflow metadata. Any PostgreSQL deployment works, whether self-hosted or managed.

- Backups should retain at least 7 days of history to enable recovery if needed.
- Enable point-in-time recovery (PITR) if your database provider supports it.
- Use read replicas for failover support.
- Restrict network access to ensure only the Terrateam server can connect.

## Terrateam Server Deployment

Terrateam servers are stateless and can be horizontally scaled.

- Run multiple instances to avoid a single point of failure.
- All instances must point to the same PostgreSQL database.
- Use a process manager like `systemd`, `supervisord`, or an orchestrator like Kubernetes.
- Ensure logs are collected for debugging and auditing.

## Load Balancer and Health Checks

A load balancer is required to distribute traffic across multiple Terrateam servers.

- Configure the load balancer to check the `/health` endpoint.
- Use connection draining to ensure requests finish before stopping an instance.
- Enable automatic failover so unhealthy instances are removed from rotation.

## Rolling Restarts and Zero Downtime Deployments

Since Terrateam is stateless, updates can be deployed without downtime.

- Rolling restarts ensure no instance is removed before another is ready.
- Load balancers should have a deregistration delay so active requests complete before an instance stops.
- Always monitor the `/health` endpoint after deploying changes.

## Security Hardening

Terrateam interacts with infrastructure credentials and GitHub repositories, so security should be a priority.

- Use the principle of least privilege for database and cloud access.
- Store credentials securely with a secret manager or environment variables.
- Restrict access to Terrateam's API to trusted sources only.
- Use TLS to encrypt database and API traffic.
- Regularly rotate database and GitHub app credentials.

## Scaling Considerations

Terrateam scales based on repository activity and concurrent workflows.

- Multiple instances can handle high request volumes.
- The database is the main bottleneck.
- Consider auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage or request volume.

## Disaster Recovery

Have a plan to restore operations if something goes wrong.

- Regularly test database backups.
- Maintain a rollback strategy for failed deployments.
- Use multiple availability zones if hosting Terrateam in the cloud.
- Document recovery procedures for quick response during incidents.

## GitHub Webhook Reliability

Terrateam relies on GitHub webhooks for processing infrastructure changes.

- Ensure the Terrateam server is accessible from GitHub's webhook IPs.
- Monitor webhook delivery logs in GitHub to catch failures early.

Following these best practices ensures a stable, secure, and scalable Terrateam deployment.
