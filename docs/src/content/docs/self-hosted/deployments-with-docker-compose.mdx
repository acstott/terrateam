description: How to deploy Terrateam without downtime using Docker Compose
---

Deploying updates to Terrateam with [Docker Compose](https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam/blob/main/docker/terrat/docker-compose.yml) can be done without downtime by following these instructions.

These instructions assume:
- You have multiple compute instances running Docker Compose with Terrateam.
- A load balancer distributes traffic between these instances.

:::note
Terrateam does not recommend running Docker Compose in production. Organizations should use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or ECS for better scalability and reliability.

## Run Multiple Instances

To maintain availability during deployments, always run at least two instances of the `server` container behind a load balancer. This ensures that at least one instance is always handling requests while another is being updated.

## Use Load Balancer Health Checks

The load balancer should only route traffic to healthy instances.

- Configure the load balancer to check the `/health` endpoint.
- This ensures traffic is not sent to containers that are starting up or failing.

## Rolling Updates with Docker Compose

The following steps outline a zero-downtime deployment using Docker Compose.

### 1. Drain One `server` Instance from the Load Balancer

- Mark one instance as draining in the load balancer to stop new connections.
- Allow active requests to complete before proceeding.

### 2. Update `docker-compose.yml` with the New Image Tag

Modify the `image` field for the drained `server` instance:

```yaml
services:
  server:
    image: ghcr.io/terrateamio/terrat-oss:<new-tag> 
    # If using the Enterprise Edition, replace `terrat-oss` with `terrat-ee`
```

### 3. Pull the New Image and Deploy the Updated Instance

- Fetch the latest image:
  ```
  docker-compose pull server
  ```
- Restart the `server` service:
  ```
  docker-compose up -d server
  ```
  This stops the old container and starts a new one with the updated image.

### 4. Verify Health Before Putting It Back in Rotation

- Wait for the load balancer to detect the instance as healthy via `/health`.
- Once healthy, allow traffic to the instance.

### 5. Repeat for the Second Instance

- Drain the second instance.
- Pull the new image:
  ```
  docker-compose pull server
  ```
- Restart it:
  ```
  docker-compose up -d server
  ```
- Wait for health checks to pass, then reintroduce it to the load balancer.

## Key Takeaways

- Always run at least two instances behind a load balancer.
- Use `/health` for load balancer health checks.
- Drain connections before restarting a container.
- Ensure the new instance is marked healthy before sending traffic.

By following these instructions, you can ensure zero-downtime deployments for Terrateam with Docker Compose.
