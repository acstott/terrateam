    (* Rendering a page can take an unbounded amount of time and in that time a
       user may choose to navigate to a different page.  To ensure the latest
       page is the one that gets rendered, we track iterations and only assign
       the results in the case of the iteration being rendering being the
       current iteration.  For example, a user has navigated to page P1 which
       takes 2 seconds to render and in that time they navigate to P2 which
       takes 1 second to render.  P2 would be rendered at 1 second and then at 2
       seconds P1 would finish rendering and replace the contents of P2
       (assuming the component it applies to still exists on the page).  But by
       tracking iterations, P1's iteration would be 1 and P2's iteration would
       be 2.  Once P2 starts it the current iteration would be 2 because there
       have been two navigations.  When P2 goes to render, it would see that the
       current iteration is 2 and its iteration is 2, therefore it can set the
       results of its render.  When P1 finishes, it would see that its iteration
       is 1 and the current iteration is 2, therefore it cannot set its results.

       There is a similar issue when rendering a page kicks off things that need
       to be cleaned up.  For example if there is a recurring background task to
       update some element of the page, we will know the clean up that task
       because the iteration it was created on does not match the current
       iteration.

       There are a few things to note in this implementation.

       The first is that this allows unnecessary work to be executed.  Because
       we do not stop P1 from rendering when we know they are navigating away
       from it, P1 will still run to completion.  This is chosen because it's
       easy to think about and it becomes painfully hard to implement a renderer
       that can be aborted at any point.  Cleaning up work becomes hard to think
       about.

       This means the UI can be confusing to a user.  For example, a loading
       indicator can be active despite P2 not loading any data.

       It also means that when P1 finishes, we do need to perform its cleanup
       operation even though we won't be rendering it.

       With all this, a user of Brtl_js should strive to make rendering happen
       as quickly as possible, use [Abb_js.fork] to background any long running
       work and aborting that work in with a [`With_cleanup]. *)
